<h3>Product variants</h3>
<p>
    A <strong>product variant</strong> is a unique version of a certain product. One product can have multiple variants based on a certain attribute. So when you sell t-shirts, you can have the same t-shirt (product) in multiple sizes and colors. In this example, each combination of     size and color is a product variant and has it's own stock and SKU.
